# marker-io-sdk-example-vue

An example of loading a Marker.io widget and using SDK methods in Vue.js

## Project setup

First make sure to install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, start your development server using:

```
npm run serve
```

Finally, navigate to http://localhost:8080 to open your running Vue app.

## Getting your project ID

The project ID is an immutable value that allows linking Marker.io to your project widget.

Get it with these simple steps:

1. Navigate to your Marker.io dashboard at https://app.marker.io
2. Open a project, then navigate to its installation settings, choose "Snippet code"
3. Copy your project ID from the snippet code itself.
